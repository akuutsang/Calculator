# FRONT END (HTML, CSS, JAVA-SCRIPT)
### About
The main goals of this exercise are:
  .To design a calculator with user interface, make this calculator functional
  . Avoid the use of eval() even though it makes the work easier and very simple : remember the eval() method has alot of potential pitfalls of evaluating insecure data, and no good programmer wants that
In this project, the HTML file for the user interface, also css for styling to make the calculator look appealing to the user
The project focuses more on JavaScript styling.
Over all ensure to make your calculator work and give the user a very good calculator experience.
